# Project 2 | Convolutional Neural Networks & Computer Graphics
 Image manipulation and two player games are common graphics applications. In this project, we
 evaluate the performance of classifiers and regressors on an image segmentation task, and
 a simple two player game. Our single classifier program generates statistical accuracy and
 confusion matrices for several classifiers and regressors (linear regression, linear SVM, k-nearest
 neighbors, and multilayer perceptron) using provided images with normals, and game play datasets
 (*Tic Tac Toe*). 

## ImageSegmentation Installation and Usage

To get started with this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use ImageSegmentation program, run the following inside the `ImageSegmentation` directory:

```bash
Python ImageSegmentation.py
```

## Datasets 
Download the RGBN Datasets from this link: https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/rgbn/ (I left them zipped and sent to ec2 instance, then unzipped once at ec2 using ```unzip \*.zip```)

Download the Tic Tac Toe datasets from this link: https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/files/23246302/download?download_frd=1 (courseworks files section)
